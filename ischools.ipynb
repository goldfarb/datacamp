    "_This is a project from the [CRDDS](https://www.colorado.edu/crdds/) [August 2025 Research Data Foundations Camp](https://cu-boulder-crdds.github.io/Research-Data-Foundations-Camp-2025-August/). The question \"what is an Information School?\" was prompted by a conversation I had during an orientation event with some faculty in CU Boulder's [example thereof](https://www.colorado.edu/cmdi/infoscience)._\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, I am interested in mapping, both geographically and disciplinarily, where the self-described Information Schools, and Information Science departments, are in the US and anglophone Canada. I am interested in places outside of this limited area, but am circumscribing the inquiry for linguistic, internet searching reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "As someone who is newly part of such a place, and with some but definitely limited understanding of the ecosystem, my sense is that there are places that could be called CS or Data Science, and places that are [GLAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLAM_(cultural_heritage)) oriented, and a few places like CU where we're doing technology & culture. I'm curious if there are other versions of Information School that I'm less aware of."
